Py2Mc will be archived for now. I am planning on bringing it back some day, but I'm not sure.

# Py2Mc - STILL IN ALPHA. DON'T USE ON PRODUCTION. MORE INFO: [here](#still-in-beta)
Py2Mc is a tool for Paper/Spigot/Bukkit servers, which allows faster/easier coding of minecraft plugins. 

## Requirements
Py2Mc requires **Python 3.10 or higher** to work correctly. We will only be supporting the latest 2 major versions. This means: if minecraft 1.20 releases,
we'll only support 1.20 and 1.19. Older versions *may* work, but we'll not help you if you need support.

We also only support the **latest** patch versions of the versions that we support. Example: 1.19.3 is supported, but 1.19.2 not. Sometimes we'll make an exceptions.
See all exceptions [here](#) (coming soon)

## Wiki
The Wiki is available [here](https://github.com/snackbag-net/Py2Mc/wiki)

## Still in beta
Py2Mc is still in the alpha phase. Lots of features are missing, and it may not export the java code correctly. Don't use!
